💡Overview
BizPulse is a powerful and impactful idea, especially in regions where businesses operate without data-driven insights. BizPulse is a business dashboard that aggregates sales, customer retention, and market trends. It allows small/local businesses know how well they are doing compared to their peers or when to take action such as increase stock, run promos, cut loss making products, etc.
